# Census PocketMod

I used this [PocketMod](http://www.pocketmod.com/) template every day at the nursing home.

Since I had to document everything that I saw residents doing, I could whip this out of my pocket anytime I saw something and jot down an activity code on the line next to their name.  Then at the end of the day, I had a nice sorted list of residents and observations that I could enter into the system.

I wrote it in PostScript so that I could generate it at work without needing to install anything.  It draws the names from names.txt, which was just a sorted list I scraped from the census report each day.  It adjusts the size and spacing based on how many residents it finds in the file, so that I can use as much space as possible.
